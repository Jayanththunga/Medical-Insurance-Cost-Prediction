Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction 

The project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting medical 
insurance costs based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical information of the 
insured individuals. The model can assist insurance companies and 
policyholders in making informed decisions regarding insurance coverage and 
pricing. The dataset used in this project includes demographic information such 
as age, gender, and location, lifestyle factors such as smoking and drinking 
habits, and medical history including BMI, blood pressure, and chronic 
conditions. After preprocessing and exploratory analysis, the dataset was split 
into training and testing sets.

We used 4 different regression methods:

1. Linear Multiple Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. XGBoost
4. Random Forest Regression
